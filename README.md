# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06 Cohort`

> Project: Module 01 Intro-to-FinTech-Challenge 

## Background
> As a fintech professional, it’s critical for us to understand how fintech companies start, evolve, and grow, to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the industry, and to stay up-to-date on advances in the rapidly evolving fintech field.

## Purpose
> In this activity, we use the ***case study*** method to conduct corporate research of a fintech business that analyzes how the company is addressing the needs and challenges in its fintech domain and using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

> In this Challenge, we will do the following:
> 1. Select a fintech domain that interests us, and then choose a company or project within that domain.
> 2. Research the domain and company.
> 3. Write a focused and detailed case study of the company or project.
> 4. Upload the [case study](https://github.com/boz-tcm/intro-to-fintech-challenge/blob/master/README.md) to our [git repository](https://github.com/boz-tcm/intro-to-fintech-challenge.git).

## The Case Study - Morningstar
</u>

*`This Case Study is presented in a question and answer format.`*

- ## Overview and Origin

    * Name of company: Morningstar, Inc. (the "Company"), headquartered in Chicago, IL, and publicly traded with most recent market cap valuation of $8.76 billion (Yahoo! Finance, June 2023).

    * When was the company incorporated?  According to Morningstar's latest SEC annual report, the Company was incorporated in 1984.

    * Who are the founders of the company?  The Company's founder is Joe Mansueto, who has served as Chairman of the board since inception, and as CEO from 1984 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2016 (SEC Annual Report, February 2023).

    * How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  The idea for Morningstar came about due to familiarity with the Company in the Investment and Wealth Management fintech domains, where the Company has a long history as a leader in the analysis and rating of mutual funds.

    * How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  The Company is funded by publicly traded equity with a book value of $1.2 billion and short and long-term debt of $1.1 billion (Yahoo! Finance, June 2023). 

- ## Business Activities

    * What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  The Company's mission since its founding has been to deliver financial information and analysis to its clients so that they can make better investment decisions.    

    * Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  According to Gitnux, Morningstar "generates revenue through a diverse range of products and services catered to institutional and individual investors, as well as financial advisors" (2023).

    * What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  Pursuant to its original mission in 1984, the Company has amassed proprietary ratings information and analysis covering a large proportion of the mutual fund industry.  The Company has since expanded this mission to include ratings and data analysis for publicly traded businesses.  Morningstar's mission is to deliver this information to  clients, including corporate and individual investors, and financial advisors, through various captive channels such as Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office. 

    * Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  According to personal conversations with Customer Relationship Manager Anthony Odro at Morningstar, the Company is primarily relying on Amazon's AWS cloud services to deliver its investment data and solutions to clients.

- ## Landscape

    * What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  Morningstar offers its services primarily within the Investment and Wealth Management financial industry domains (Smith, 2022).

    * What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    * What are the other major companies in this domain?  Other major companies offering similar services as Morningstar in the Investment and Wealth Management domains include:
        1. Bloomberg
        2. S&P Global
        3. Envestnet, parent company of competitor MoneyGuide
        4. Fidelity, parent company of competitor eMoney
        5. Orion

- ## Results

    * What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    * What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    * How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

- ## Recommendations

    * If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  I would recommend to the Company that they continue to build out and reinvest in their Investment and Wealth Management platforms to bring more features and services to their delivery platforms, including through their Morningstar Direct, Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office Cloud platforms.  For example, the Company's Advisor Workstation and Office Cloud platforms could be greatly improved

    * Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    * What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    * Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
