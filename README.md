# `Columbia Engineering FinTech Bootcamp 2023-06`

> Project: Module 01 Intro-to-FinTech-Challenge 

## Background
> As a fintech professional, it’s critical for us to understand how fintech companies start, evolve, and grow, to be able to speak knowledgeably about the major players in the industry, and to stay up-to-date on advances in the rapidly evolving fintech field.

> In this activity, we use the case study method to conduct corporate research of a fintech business that analyzes how the company is addressing the needs and challenges of its fintech domain and using its technology to solve a standing financial problem.

> In this Challenge, we will:

1. Select a fintech domain that interests us, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

2. Research the domain and company.

3. Write a detailed, focused case study of the company or project.

4. Upload the case study to our [git repository](https://github.com/boz-tcm/intro-to-fintech-challenge.git).

One of the key methods used to conduct corporate analysis is the **case study**. Case studies are often 50–100 pages or more, but your task is to create a more focused case study that analyzes how a FinTech company is responding to the problems and needs of the FinTech domain it is in, and how it is using technology to solve a standing financial problem.

In this homework assignment, you will:

* Select a Fintech domain that interests you, and then choose a company or project within that domain.

* Research the domain and company.

* Write a detailed case study of the company.

* Upload your case study to your git repository.

This assignment will challenge you to polish your FinTech research skills by accessing reports, publications, and online resources that FinTech professionals use to evaluate the industry. It will also help you situate the techniques and technologies you will be mastering in this course––e.g., machine learning, Python, modeling, blockchain––within the real world of global FinTech. Finally, it will give you practice presenting and speaking about FinTech strategy and technology.

## Instructions

### 1. Choose a FinTech domain that you find relevant or interesting.

**Note:** We covered a number of FinTech domains in class this week. If you already have a company in mind that you want to research, skip ahead to Step 3.

* Payments/Billing

* Capital Investment

* Investment Management

* Wealth Management

* Enterprise Solutions

* Insurance (InsurTech)

* Mortgage/Real Estate

* Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

* Lending

* Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

* Regulation Technology (RegTech)

* Open Banking

* Robo-advising

Remember that because FinTech is an evolving field, different FinTech reports may use different names and definitions for various domains and sectors (e.g., CB Insights, Investopedia, Accenture). In addition, you may come across lists of FinTech domains online that are either longer or shorter than the list above; there is no one comprehensive list.

### 2. Choose a company (or project) within  your chosen Fintech domain.

Use online research to identify the trends in your domain, and choose a company that is successful or otherwise interesting to you. For example, if you chose Wealth Management, you may want to look at online journals, periodicals, reports, and websites about the future of Wealth Management, or how FinTech is changing or disrupting Wealth Management.

Your company could be:

* A new, emerging FinTech company that is doing well in a particular domain. Examples include Square, Plaid, Lemonade, RobinHood, and Coinbase.

* A large incumbent financial or technology company that is doing something interesting and new with technology. Examples include Goldman Sachs’ Marcus, JP Morgan’s JPMCoin, Facebook Libra, and Apple Card.

* A smaller start-up that is not yet wildly successful, but that you find promising and interesting. This may include a FinTech company in your local area or a company with a new idea that you would like to learn more about.

### 3. Conduct your research, using the case study template as a guide.

We recommend that you use the case study template below in order to focus your research. You may lengthen, shorten, or––if necessary––remove sections from the template to accommodate the information available about your company.

**Note** If you have chosen a project within a larger company (such as the Apple Credit Card), you may want to focus your research on the origins and scope of the project rather than on the company itself.

# **<u>Case Study for Morningstar, Inc. in the Wealth and Investment Management Fintech Domain</u>**

*This Case Study is presented in a question and answer format.*

## <u>Overview and Origin</u>

* Name of company: Morningstar, Inc. (the "Company"), headquartered in Chicago, IL, and publicly traded with most recent market cap valuation of $8.76 billion (Yahoo! Finance, June 2023).

* When was the company incorporated?  According to Morningstar's latest SEC annual report, the Company was incorporated in 1984.

* Who are the founders of the company?  The Company's founder is Joe Mansueto, who has served as Chairman of the board since inception, and as CEO from 1984 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2016 (SEC Annual Report, February 2023).

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  The idea for Morningstar came about due to familiarity with the Company in the Investment and Wealth Management fintech domains, where the Company has a long history as a leader in the analysis and rating of mutual funds.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  The Company is funded by publicly traded equity with a book value of $1.2 billion and short and long-term debt of $1.1 billion (Yahoo! Finance, June 2023). 

## <u>Business Activities:</u>

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?  The Company's mission since its founding has been to deliver financial information and analysis to its clients so that they can make better investment decisions.    

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  According to Gitnux, Morningstar "generates revenue through a diverse range of products and services catered to institutional and individual investors, as well as financial advisors" (2023).

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  Pursuant to its original mission in 1984, the Company has amassed proprietary ratings information and analysis covering a large proportion of the mutual fund industry.  The Company has since expanded this mission to include ratings and data analysis for publicly traded businesses.  Morningstar's mission is to deliver this information to  clients, including corporate and individual investors, and financial advisors, through various captive channels such as Morningstar Direct, Morningstar Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  According to personal conversations with Customer Relationship Manager Anthony Odro at Morningstar, the Company is primarily relying on Amazon's AWS cloud services to deliver its investment data and solutions to clients.

## <u>Landscape:</u>

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?  Morningstar offers its services primarily within the Investment and Wealth Management financial industry domains (Smith, 2022).

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?  Other major companies offering similar services as Morningstar in the Investment and Wealth Management domains include:
    1. Bloomberg
    2. S&P Global
    3. Envestnet, parent company of competitor MoneyGuide
    4. Fidelity, parent company of competitor eMoney
    5. Orion

        (Sources: G2.com; Kitces.com;  )

## <u>Results</u>

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## <u>Recommendations</u>

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  I would recommend to the Company that they continue to build out and reinvest in their Investment and Wealth Management platforms to bring more features and services to their delivery platforms, including through their Morningstar Direct, Advisor Workstation, and Morningstar Office Cloud platforms.  For example, the Company's Advisor Workstation and Office Cloud platforms could be greatly improved

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

### 4. Write the case study.

Write the finished case study report in a markdown `README.md` file, using the above case study template. Your report should be sufficiently long to ensure you provide all relevant information about the company or project in a thorough manner.

Be sure to cite your sources in an addendum at the end of the report. List all websites, podcasts, blogs, or articles that you consulted in order to write the report, and provide links. Your list should be thorough and account for all sources you used, but it does not need to be a formal works cited page.


### 5. Upload your case study to your git repository.

You learned some technical aspects of FinTech this week, including how to set up and populate a git repository. As a final step, take your finished case study and upload it to a repository to share with your instructor and class.

> Project: Module 13 Neural-Networks-Challenge

> Background: We work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a fictitious venture capital firm. The Alphabet Soup business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked us to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

> The team has given us a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. This file contains various types of information about the organizations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.

> Purpose: In this activity, we use our newfound Neural Net machine learning and Python skills to predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful.  We create a binary classification model using a deep neural network to complete this task, which includes the following three technical deliverables:
1. Preprocess data for a neural network model.
2. Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
3. Optimize the model.
